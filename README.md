The goal of the Intero API is to help you build Unity applications which work across different cardio machines, biometric sensors, and wearables. Imagine building a machine-agnostic app which allows users to compete online with friends, no matter which gym they go to. The Intero API is currently integrated with Concept2 row, ski, and bike ergs, as well as Wahoo sensors. We will continue expanding these integrations.

The libraries include:

* Bluetooth LE Library
* Online Competition Library
* Workout Management Library
* Leaderboard Library (development in progress)
* Social Media Library (development in progress)
* Cloud Tracking Library (development in progress)
